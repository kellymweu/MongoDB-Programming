# MongoDB-Programming
Bookstore Library Database

App.js is the server code in node.js

db.js is a node.js file describing the location of the database and this is imported into app.js

package.json initializes and tracks the dependencies and relevant parameters

books.json is an export from MongoDb of the sample data used in this project

mongodb books.db is a txt file of some of the shortcuts i have learnt while studying the use of mongodb

The database is named Bookstore and within Bookstore, there exists the collection named Books to store the book data

The db is managed within mongoDbcompass locally and mongoDbatlas online.

Additionally, I used postman to manage API testing for the methods GET (retrieve data), PATCH (update existing fields), POST (create new data), DELETE (remove data)

Locally, the app runs on port 3000
